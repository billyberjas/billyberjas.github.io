# Woodoku Clone (HTML/CSS/JS)

A simple Woodoku-like puzzle game implemented with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to run
- Open index.html directly in your browser, or
- Serve the folder with a static server, e.g.:
  - Python: python3 -m http.server 8080
  - Node (if installed): npx serve -p 8080

Gameplay
- Two ways to play:
  - Drag & drop: Drag a piece from the Pieces panel onto the 9x9 board and drop on a cell.
  - Click to place: Click a piece to select it, then click a board cell to place it.
- If a placement is invalid, try another spot.
- Fill entire rows, columns, or 3Ã—3 squares to clear them and earn bonus points.
- The game ends when none of the available pieces can be placed anywhere.

Notes
- This is a minimal clone for learning/demo purposes and not affiliated with the original game.
